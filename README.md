# CS2400 Individual Assignment: Multiple and Polynomial Regression Analysis of Death Rate Determinants

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive statistical analysis of death rate determinants using multiple and polynomial regression techniques.  This analysis was completed as part of the CS2400 Individual Assignment at Nanyang Technological University (March 2025).

## Project Description
The analysis examines how various socioeconomic and environmental factors influence regional death rates.  Two regression approaches were implemented:  
1.	Multiple Regression: Analyzing the relationship between death rates and two independent variables (schooling levels and non-white population percentage).
2.	Polynomial Regression: Investigating the non-linear relationship between death rates and non-white population percentage.

## Critical Files
•   Benjamin_Oliver_Yick_U2120984H.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis, visualizations, and findings.  
•	CS2400 Individual Assignment Briefs (AY24-25 - Semester 1).pdf: Official assignment requirements and guidelines from Nanyang Technological University, outlining the multiple and polynomial regression tasks, submission guidelines, and evaluation criteria.  
•	Individual Assignment Dataset (AY24-25 - Semester 1).csv: Extracted dataset used for the regression analysis.  
•	Report.md: 150-word summary of findings.  
•	Memorandum.md: 400-word memorandum suggesting additional variables for death rate prediction.  

## Methods Used
•	Data exploration and visualization.  
•	Correlation analysis.  
•	Multiple linear regression.  
•	Polynomial regression.  
•	Cramer’s Rule for solving standard equations.  
•	Residual analysis.  

## Critical Findings
•	Variables x6 (schooling for persons over 22) and x9 (percent non-white population) showed strong correlations with death rates.  
•	The multiple regression model achieved an R² of 0.5628.  
•	Polynomial regression of x9 revealed a non-linear relationship with death rates.  
•	Three additional variables (healthcare access, chronic disease prevalence, and income inequality) were proposed to improve the prediction.
