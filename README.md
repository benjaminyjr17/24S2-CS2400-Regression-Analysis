# 24S2-CS2400 Individual Assignment: Multiple and Polynomial Regression Analysis of Death Rate Determinants  

## Overview  
This repository contains a comprehensive statistical analysis of death rate determinants using multiple and polynomial regression techniques.  This analysis was completed as part of the CS2400 Individual Assignment at Nanyang Technological University (31-MARCH-2025).

## Project Description  
This analysis examines how various socioeconomic and environmental factors influence regional death rates.  Two regression approaches were implemented:  
1.	Multiple Regression: Analyzing the relationship between death rates and two independent variables (schooling levels and non-white population percentage).  
2.	Polynomial Regression: Investigating the non-linear relationship between death rates and non-white population percentage.  

## Critical Files

â€¢	CS2400 Individual Assignment Briefs (AY24-25 - Semester 1).pdf: Official assignment requirements and guidelines from Nanyang Technological University, outlining the multiple and polynomial regression tasks, submission guidelines, and evaluation criteria.  
â€¢	Individual Assignment Dataset (AY24-25 - Semester 1).csv: Extracted dataset used for the regression analysis.  
â€¢	Report.md: 150-word summary of findings.  
â€¢	Memorandum.md: 400-word memorandum suggesting additional variables for death rate prediction.  

## Methods Used  
â€¢	Correlation analysis.  
â€¢	Cramerâ€™s Rule for solving standard equations.  
â€¢	Data exploration and visualization.  
â€¢	Multiple linear regression.  
â€¢	Polynomial regression.  
â€¢	Residual analysis.  

## Critical Findings  
â€¢	Polynomial regression of xâ‚‰ revealed a non-linear relationship with death rates.  
â€¢	Variables xâ‚† (schooling for persons over 22) and xâ‚‰ (percentage non-white population) showed strong correlations with death rates.  
â€¢	The multiple regression model achieved an **RÂ² score of 0.5628.**  
â€¢	The polynomial regression model achieved an **RÂ² score of 0.4157.**  
â€¢	Three additional variables (healthcare access, chronic disease prevalence, and income inequality) were proposed to improve the prediction.  

## Final Equations  
The analysis yielded the following regression models for predicting death rates:  

### Multiple Regression Model  
**y = 1211.8562 + (-28.9793)xâ‚† + (3.9165)xâ‚‰**, **RÂ² = 0.5628.**  

Where:  
â€¢	y = death rate.  
â€¢	xâ‚† = schooling for persons over 22.  
â€¢	xâ‚‰ = percentage non-white population.  

This model explains approximately **56.28%** of the variance in death rates, with education level having a negative relationship with mortality, while non-white population percentage shows a positive correlation.  

### Polynomial Regression Model  
**y = 882.9963 + (5.2506)xâ‚‰ + (-0.0227)xâ‚‰Â²**, **RÂ² = 0.4157.**  

This non-linear model captures the curvilinear relationship between nonwhite population percentage and death rates, explaining **41.57%** of the variance in mortality rates.  

These models demonstrate that socioeconomic factors significantly influence mortality outcomes, with education as a protective factor, while demographic composition shows more complex relationships requiring polynomial modeling.
