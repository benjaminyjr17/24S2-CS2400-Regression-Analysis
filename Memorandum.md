# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Senior Policy Advisors, United Nations (UN) Population Division.  
**FROM:** Benjamin Oliver Yick.  
**DATE:** 31-MARCH-2025.  
**SUBJECT:** Recommendations for Improving Death Rate Predictions in Aging Populations.
 
### Introduction
This memo presents three key variables that could significantly enhance our ability to predict death rates in aging populations. Our regression analysis of mortality data revealed that while factors such as education levels and demographic composition strongly correlate with death rates, additional variables would improve predictive accuracy.
 
### Recommended Variables for Enhanced Death Rate Prediction
 
#### 1. Access to Healthcare (Doctors per Thousand Population)
The density of medical professionals directly impacts mortality rates, particularly in aging populations. Countries with higher doctor-to-population ratios typically experience lower death rates due to:
* More timely disease diagnosis and intervention.
* Better management of chronic conditions common in elderly populations.
* Reduced wait times for critical procedures.
* Enhanced preventive care capabilities.
 
Nations with aging demographics should prioritize and improve this metric, as each doctor must manage more age-related conditions as the population ages.
 
#### 2. Chronic Disease Prevalence Index (CDPI)
We recommend developing a comprehensive index tracking the prevalence of chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD, dementia, and cancer). This variable would significantly enhance death rate predictions because:
* Chronic diseases account for approximately 71% of global deaths, according to WHO.
* The burden of chronic disease increases disproportionately with population aging.
* Regional variations in disease patterns impact mortality.
* Effective policy interventions can target high-prevalence conditions.
 
This index would allow for targeted healthcare resource allocation and more accurate mortality forecasting in regions with specific disease burdens.
 
#### 3. Income Inequality (Gini Coefficient)
Beyond absolute economic measures, income inequality has emerged as a critical predictor of population health outcomes. Including the Gini coefficient would improve death rate predictions by capturing the following:
* Disparities in healthcare access across socioeconomic groups.
* Variations in health-supporting infrastructure in different communities.
* Stress-related health impacts associated with relative deprivation.
* Differences in health literacy and preventive behavior adoption.
 
Research shows societies with higher inequality experience higher mortality rates, even when controlling for average income levels.
 
### Conclusion
Incorporating these three variables, healthcare access, chronic disease prevalence, and income inequality, would improve our death rate prediction models. This enhanced predictive capability would better equip member states to develop effective policies addressing the economic, fiscal, and security challenges of population aging and potential decline.
 
We recommend prioritizing data collection on these metrics and integrating them into standard population analysis frameworks.
